Backburner is a library that provides support for cooperative multitasking in JavaScript.

Backburner was inspired by Dave Herman's jstask.js (https://github.com/dherman/jstask),
but is designed to work in any JavaScript runtime environment targeted by CoffeeScript.

Backburner is alpha software under active development. Neither its API or implementation
are stable.  I hope to release 0.1 in the next few weeks.
